Notes:

- Most interesting/complete plots: scenario 10 and scenario 4 (conditions with the least convergence problems/warnings) => censoring=0.15 and interval=4

- Discard scenarios 3, 6 and 9 : there are very few models that do not have any convergence issues or warnings when sigma2.f = 3, few sample size leads to unreliable interpretation for the sim study.

- beta_est is almost identical across all models

- sigma2.f_est is almost identical across coxme, coxph and glmm. The coxph_gamma model is underestimated 

- ICC seems to be consistently higher in the glmm model (ICC) compared to the coxme and coxph models (ICC_np). Consistent with Figure 2 that shows that as the variance of the random effect increases the ICC value becomes larger than the ICC_np (proportionally).
